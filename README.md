# Used-Car-Price-Predictor-Linear-Regression

## Used Car Price Recommendation System using Linear Regression
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the price of used cars based on various features. The model is built using the scikit-learn library in Python and utilizes a Linear Regression algorithm. Categorical features are encoded using the One Hot Encoding technique.

## Data
- `Car Data.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing the model. You can download the original dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafaimam/used-car-prices-in-pakistan-2021).

## Files included
- `Used cars price prediction.ibynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the model, evaluating its performance, and saving the model to a file.
- `Car Data.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset, used for training and testing the model.
- `LinearRegression.pkl`: Pickle file containing the trained model saved for future use.
- `Load model.ibynb`:  Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to load the pre-trained model and make predictions.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies
- **pandas**
- **scikit-learn**

## Loading the Model and Making Predictions
1. Open the Load Model.ibynb Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook cells to load the pre-trained model from the LinearRegression.pkl file.
3. Define the input data for which you want to predict the car price.
4. Run the prediction cell to get the predicted car price.
